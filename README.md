# Pokemon Bot
This is the rewritten version, of my original project called Pokemon Bot.

## What is Pokemon Bot?
Pokemon Bot is a discord bot, that is like the legendary Pokecord discord bot,
but rather than cutting corners, and ruin the idea of pokemon, or remove the stuff
that makes pokemon fun, Pokemon Bot will fix that. Pokemon Bot will be a discord bot
that tries its best to be as close as possible to the mainstream games as a text based game.

## What will be on Pokemon Bot?
Everything!!! Like I said, it will not be a cutting-corner project, it will
have everything that makes pokemon, pokemon.

## I am a developer, and I want to help, but how can I ?!
Thats prefect. The best way to help is making PRs. Don't worry,
I will always give credit to people that helped make this bot.
I try to comment as much as I can, but I do that after most everything is done
so don't be afraid to ask me about something. Also don't mind my code style.
I personally like using allman brace-style over k&R brace-style.
~~mostly because I program more in c#, which uses allman.~~ But I am fine with you
using a different code style than me. As well I am fine with you changing eslintrc.json,
to fit your code style. all I ask is that you put it into the .gitignore, so it doesn't
interfere with my code style, when you make the PR. Thanks ^-^


In the `index.js` there is a TODO list. That list has everything that is needed to be done, before deployment.
Please let me know if you have questions, or having some difficulty with something

Thank you for helping me out ^-^

## The Board of Amazing People that Made this bot Possible


## How to use this repo.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
the project is using Quick.DB for storage, so yea. It would be pretty dumb of me if used mongodb, when this is more of a community project, so yea. Also its easy for newer people to understand.

## How to contribute to the repo
Simply do PRs (Pull Requests).

## Anything I need to know?
Yes, a few things, both before starting, and during your time working on it.

- The first thing is that you should have some knowledge of javascript, and discord.js. The main reason is because this project will be very advance, and not knowing any javascript, or discord.js will hinder your understanding of what is happening.
- I plan on moving this project to typescript for a number of reasons. First one being static typing is my jam. I personally like static typing over dynamic typing most of the time, as I said before I program mostly in C#. C# is primarily a static typed language.
The Other reason is to abuse unit testing. I plan on using unit testing to make it easier to test different scenarios before trying it for real, and accidentally break the db.
