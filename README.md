# Pokemon Bot
This is the rewritten version, of my original project called Pokemon Bot.

## What is Pokemon Bot?
Pokemon Bot is a discord bot, that is like the legendary Pokecord discord bot,
but rather than cutting corners, and ruin the idea of pokemon, or remove the stuff
that makes pokemon fun, Pokemon Bot will fix that. Pokemon Bot will be a discord bot
that tries its best to be as close as possible to the mainstream games as a text based game.

## What will be on Pokemon Bot?
Everything!!! Like I said, it will not be a cutting-corner project, it will
have everything that makes pokemon, pokemon.

## I am a developer, and I want to help, but how can I ?!
Thats prefect. The best way to help is making PRs. Don't worry,
I will always give credit to people that helped make this bot.
I try to comment as much as I can, but I do that after most everything is done
so don't be afraid to ask me about something. Also don't mind my code style.
I personally like using allman brace-style over k&R brace-style.
~~mostly because I program more in c#, which uses allman.~~ But I am fine with you
using a different code style than me. As well i am fine with you changing eslintrc.json,
to fit your code style. all I ask is that you put it into the .gitignore, so it doesn't
interfere with my code style, when you make the PR. Thanks ^-^


In the `index.js` there is a TODO list. That list has everything that is needed to be done, before deployment.
Please let me know if you have questions, or having some difficulty with something

Thank you for helping me out ^-^
