# This is the Team Subcommand Folder.
## What is this folder for?
This folder is for the subcommands in the team command. since in discord.js there is no actually way to make group commands, like in `discord.net`, `dsharpplusplus`, and `serenity`, we have to make them inside the command. But rather than doing that, it is easier to make a folder, and have the subcommands in their own files, as modules. THis reduce the amount of lines needed in the team command, and enables more organization.
